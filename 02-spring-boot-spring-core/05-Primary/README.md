# @Primary Annotation
@Primary annotation defines a **default** component to use in case multiple components are available.

There can be only **1** class using the primary annotation for an implementation.

Qualifier annotation has a **higher** priority than primary annotation.

Qualifer annotation also allows you to be very specific.
